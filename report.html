    <h4>Honor statement:</h4>
    <p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. 
        I may have asked questions about the assignment on Piazza, I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. 
        I also already know that this class is graded on a curve. 
        I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates. 
        Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

    <h4>2: FAST feature detector</h4>

    <p>My FAST detector picks up many of the points from the same feature. As mentioned in the FAST tutorial, it catches many redundant features. 
        By filtering them based on Harris cornerness scores, we get rid of the redundant features and keep the key ones, as can be seen in set 1 
        where most of the features picked up by fast on the whiteboard were thrown away, keeping the actual corners of the letters. 
        Another benefit is that we get rid of many outliers, as can be seen below in the feature matching. 
        For performance, my_fast_detector's total time was 5.892s giving an average of 0.74s over 8 calls. 
        fastr's total time was 4.115s giving and average of 1.04s over 4 calls. So this added robustness cost us about 41% performance.</p>
    
    
    <h4>3: Point description and matching</h4>

    <p>I couldn't get the exact figures since I use the same function for both FAST and FASTR features, but I set it up so it shows the 
        matches on the figure everytime it gets computed. I can definitely FEEL the difference between the two - it takes a 
        bit longer for the FAST matches to pop up - and I would assume so because the sample size 
        is so much bigger when doing FAST points.

    <h4>4: RANSAC and Panoramas</h4>

    <img src="S4-panorama.png" alt="S4-panorama" width="600">
    
    <p>I actually tried to experiment with the parameters such as increasing the confidence interval for the FAST features,
        but I found that the default values gave me good results all around.
        I will mention the imperfections such as the wood on the right side of the SFU panorama and the ceiling pieces on S2
        , but I will forgive them since they're on the very edge.
